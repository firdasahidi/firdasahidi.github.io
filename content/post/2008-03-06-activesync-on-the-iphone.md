Apple has just given me one more reason to possibly switch to an iPhone...

[iPhone opens to Exchange e-mail](http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/06/iPhone-opens-to-Exchange-e-mail_1.html?source=rss&url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/06/iPhone-opens-to-Exchange-e-mail_1.html)

I'm currently using a Samsung BlackJack II, a Windows Mobile 6-based device with 3G connectivity. The e-mail functionality is great, but not having an easy way to keep my Address Book contacts in sync with my phone is a major hassle. It looks like using an iPhone would help address that.

Now all we need is 3G (UMTS/HSDPA) functionality and a price drop...OK, at least the first is an actual possibility.
