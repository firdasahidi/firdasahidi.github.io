Apple released another security update today, [Security Update 2006-002](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453), that addresses the security flaw that was [unsuccessfully plugged][1] with Security Update 2006-001.

Per Apple's description of the update, the update provides "additional checks" to prevent malicious file types from being opened automatically. In addition, the update addresses a few other security flaws in CoreTypes, Mail, apache\_mod\_php, and rsync. Full details are in the article linked above.

And while we're on the topic of security updates, Microsoft is expected to release one critical security update for Microsoft Office and one important security update for Microsoft Windows tomorrow on "patch Tuesday." More information is available from [Microsoft's web site](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/advance.mspx), but is subject to change until the final security bulletin is released.
