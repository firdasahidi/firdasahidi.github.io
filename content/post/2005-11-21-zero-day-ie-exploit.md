[This article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1891749,00.asp) discusses a newly-discovered zero-day exploit for Internet Explorer, including IE on fully-patched Windows XP SP2 systems. (Apparently, only Windows Server 2003 with the Enhanced Security Configuration is immune.)

No patch has been released, and no security advisory had been posted at the time this was written. A Microsoft security advisory was expected at any moment.

In the meantime, switch to [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/). No, really---I'm serious.

**UPDATE:** Microsoft has posted a [security advisory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/911302.mspx) about this issue.
