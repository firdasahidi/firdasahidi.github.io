title: Happy Thanksgiving 2017

In the US, today (Thursday, November 23) is Thanksgiving. I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the meaning of Thanksgiving.<!--more-->

Thanksgiving means different things to different people:

* To folks outside the US, it often just a day with drastically reduced email volume and no interruptions from US-based coworkers. (Enjoy!)
* To folks in the US, it's a holiday filled with food (turkey, anyone?). There may also be family gatherings, football (American football, of course), and possibly some shopping. (There will most certainly be shopping tomorrow.)
* To many people, it's also a time to be thankful or grateful for the good things in their lives.
* To Christians, like myself, it's often a time to reflect on the blessings that God placed in your life. I know that I am quite blessed---blessed with a great family, an amazing wife, and the opportunity to work in a fast-paced industry (among many _many_ other blessings).

Whatever Thanksgiving means to you, I hope that you enjoy the holiday. Happy Thanksgiving!
