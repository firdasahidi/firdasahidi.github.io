I wanted to let readers know that there will be a break in my blogging over the next few weeks. Crystal and I are celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and have decided to take a very long trip to someplace very far away from civilization so that we can relax, unplug, and simply enjoy each other's company.<!--more-->

I'll be back in civilization on June 7, and you can expect a quick post summarizing our trip (maybe with some photos). I'll also have some feedback on how the Peak Designs 20L photo backpack worked out for me. Until then, have a great one!
