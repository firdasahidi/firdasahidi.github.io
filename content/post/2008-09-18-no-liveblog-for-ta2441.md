I originally had TA2441, VI3 Networking Concepts and Best Practices, on my schedule, but upon a close review of the agenda it looks like this is all stuff I've seen before. In fact, it looks like stuff I've written about quite extensively, so I'm skipping out on this session. Sorry to disappoint anyone!
