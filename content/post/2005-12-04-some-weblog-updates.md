There's been a few updates to this weblog over the last few days. Nothing major, just a few minor changes here and there.

First, I've moved to showing excerpts only on the index page. Of course, the archives pages (both category archives as well as monthly archives) were already showing excerpts only. Note that RSS feeds are still showing the full content.

The full entry page (the "single page," in WordPress parlance) now shows the sidebar as well. It seems to me that this makes navigation through the weblog a bit easier.

I've already mentioned the link to automatically post an entry's URL to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/); this link only shows up when reading the full post.
