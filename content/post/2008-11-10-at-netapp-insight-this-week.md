I'm in Los Angeles this week for NetApp Insight. This is the internal and partner-only conference that used to be called Fall Classic. The particularly cool part is that I'll actually be presenting this week! On Wednesday, I'll be giving a presentation on integrating NetApp and VMware technologies. Wish me luck!

Virtually all of the content this week is NDA material, so I won't be able to post any information here. If there is any information I can share I'll be sure to post it.
