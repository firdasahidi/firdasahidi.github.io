A pair of recent articles ([this article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880142,00.asp) at _eWeek_ and [this article](http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/03/2255215) at NewsForge) have me a bit perplexed. What's the real value of MapFS? I know I have to be missing something here. Somebody send me an e-mail and explain it to me, or give me an example (other than the Live CD example mentioned in one of the articles above) of how this could be used effectively.
