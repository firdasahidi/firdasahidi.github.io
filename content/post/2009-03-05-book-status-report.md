It's been about a month since I [signed an agreement][1] with Wiley Publishing to write a virtualization-centered book. Since that time, it's been full steam ahead. Things are going a bit more slowly than I would have liked, but I've still met all my deadlines (thus far!) so I can't really complain. The group of people I'm working with at Wiley are a great group and I can already tell just how much help they will be in making sure that this book is a top-quality product.

I'm also excited that a technical editor has been selected for my book. A number of virtualization experts---including a couple of recently-christened vExperts---offered to serve as technical editor. All of them are more than qualified to write this book, even more so to be the technical editor! In the end, though, I'm pleased to announce that [Rick Scherer of VMwareTips.com](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/) will be the technical editor for the book. Rick has a solid technical background and I'm confident we'll work well together. To everyone else who offered to work with me on this project, thanks for offering and I'm hoping that we'll get the opportunity to work together in the future.

If you're a reader of VMwareTips.com, then, don't be too dismayed if Rick's excellent technical content slows down a bit over the next few weeks or months. It's just because I've got him busy double-checking all my stuff!
