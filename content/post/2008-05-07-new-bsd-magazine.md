A new print magazine focused on the various BSD operating systems---FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD---has started up. You can get more information about the magazine at [http://www.bsdmag.org](http://www.bsdmag.org).

I've written about OpenBSD several times here, and while I'm lightyears from being any sort of BSD expert I have a great deal of respect for the BSDs. (After all, Mac OS X is based on FreeBSD.) If I weren't so incredibly overloaded on technologies as it is, I'd probably be interested in learning more about all the BSDs. Unfortunately, there's only 24 hours in a day, and other technologies---like virtualization, VMware, storage, SANs, etc.--already keep me busy enough as it is.

Best of luck to the new BSD Magazine editors! I hope the new magazine is successful.
