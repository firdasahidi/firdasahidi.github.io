I'm in San Diego this week for VMware Partner Exchange 2008. I'm signed up for mostly "Advanced Technical Track" sessions, so I'm hoping to gain a lot of knowledge and value out of the sessions. I don't know how much information, if any, I'll be able to share here; I suspect that a great deal of information will be covered by NDA and can't be shared publicly.

If you happen to be at Partner Exchange, feel free to catch up with me.
