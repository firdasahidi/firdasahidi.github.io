This year [VMworld][link-3]---VMware's annual user conference---moves back to San Francisco from Las Vegas. Returning to the Bay Area with VMworld is [Spousetivities][link-2], which is happening again this year for the **11th year at VMworld**. Better get your tickets sooner rather than later, there's quite a good chance these activities will sell out!<!--more-->

[Registration][link-1] is open right now.

This year's activities are funded in part by the generous and community-minded support of [Veeam][link-5] and [VMUG][link-6], who are "putting their money where their mouth is" when it comes to promoting strong work/life balance at events like VMworld.

Here's a quick look at what's planned for VMworld 2019 in San Francisco:

**Monday, August 26**: Spousetivities kicks off the week with a walking food tour. This tour, like all the others, will depart from the Marriott Marquis.

**Tuesday, August 27**: This full-day event will take participants up to Wine Country for several wine tastings. Transportion is provided, of course, and participants will enjoy lunch on the tour as well.

**Wednesday, August 28**: Nature, shopping, tranquility, and quaint towns---this tour has it all! Participants will visit the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin headlands, Muir Woods, and Sausalito. Transportion and lunch are provided, of course.

**Thursday, August 29**: The week's activities will wrap up with a visit to the famous spots and sights of Silicon Valley, including the Computer History Museum and the Google campus. Lunch and transportation are included.

Participants are welcome to sign up for any of these activities individually, but there's also a "full week pass" that offers a discount when compared to signing up for all activities separately.

Head on over to [the registration page][link-1] to get more information about any of the activities, or to sign up. Remember that although it's called "Spousetivities," anyone is welcome! You don't have to be a spouse to attend.
