After reading this article about [fourth-generation rootkits](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841266,00.asp), I can't help but think that there has to be a better way to get information out about these kinds of threats. Are we warning about pending threats, or are we creating the new threats ourselves? Do these kinds of presentations help us protect our computers and our networks, or do they give the other side the ammunition they need?
