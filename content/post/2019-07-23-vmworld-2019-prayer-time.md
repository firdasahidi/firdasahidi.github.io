For the last several years, I've organized a brief morning prayer time at [VMworld][link-1]. I didn't attend the conference last year, but organized a prayer time nevertheless (and was able to join one morning for prayer). This year, now that I'm back at VMware (via the Heptio acquisition) and speaking at the conference, I'd once again like to coordinate a time for believers to meet. So, if you're a Christian interested in gathering together with other Christians for a brief time of prayer, here are the details.<!--more-->

**What:** A brief time of prayer

**Where:** Yerba Buena Gardens behind Moscone North (near the waterfall)

**When:** Monday 8/26 through Thursday 8/29 at 7:45am (this should give everyone enough time to grab breakfast before keynotes/sessions start at 9am)

**Who:** All courteous attendees are welcome, but please note this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centric activity (note that I encourage believers of other faiths/religions to organize equivalent activities)

**Why:** To spend a few minutes in prayer over the day, the conference, the attendees, and each other

As in previous years, you don't need to RSVP or anything like that, although you're welcome to if you'd like (just [hit me up on Twitter][link-2]).

There's no need to bring anything other than an open heart, your faith, and a willingness to display that faith in front of others. The gathering is very casual---we'll gather together, share a few prayer requests and needs, and then give folks the opportunity to pray as they feel led. If you don't like praying out loud in public, no problem; we're not going to force anyone. You're welcome to pray silently. We just want to give believers the opportunity to strengthen one another in the faith.

Here's hoping I see you there! If you're a Christian and planning to attend, please reach out to other Christians you may know and tell them about morning prayer at VMworld!
