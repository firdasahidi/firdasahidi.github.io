VMware has completed Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) certifications for both VMware vSphere 4.0 as well as ESX/ESXi 3.5 Update 4. This brings the list of SVVP-certified products to include:

* VMware vSphere 4.0 (ESX 4.0 and ESXi 4.0)
* VMware ESX 3.5 Update 4
* VMware ESXi 3.5 Update 4
* VMware ESX 3.5 Update 3
* VMware ESXi 3.5 Update 3
* VMware ESX 3.5 Update 2

According to my contacts within VMware---and many of you have probably heard the same---the company is seeking to achieve SVVP certification for _every_ ESX and ESXi release from 3.5 Update 2 onward for the maximum supported configuration of both CPUs and RAM on both Intel and AMD platforms. That includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Server.
