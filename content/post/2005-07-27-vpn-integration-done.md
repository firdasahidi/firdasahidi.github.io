That was easier than I expected. I managed to get my hardware firewall to authenticate VPN connections against Active Directory via [RADIUS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS) (using Internet Authentication Service, or IAS) without a great deal of effort. In fact, it was almost easy. If I ever get caught up on documentation, I'll post some details on how to do it on the [Mercurion Systems](http://www.mercurionsystems.com/index.html) web site.
