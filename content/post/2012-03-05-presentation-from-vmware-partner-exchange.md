On February 13, just before the official start of VMware Partner Exchange in Las Vegas, NV, I had the opportunity to present at the EMC Boot Camp. It's beginning to seem that all my presentations focus on stretched clusters, but I assure you that's not the case (give me a day or two and I'll prove it to you). In any case, [here's the deck][1] that I used during my presentation at the EMC Boot Camp.

Part 1 of this presentation closely mirrors the presentation that I gave in Australia (see [here][2]); Part 2, however, is new material that was presented for the first time at the EMC Boot Camp. This part contains some current recommended practices in the event you decide that a stretched cluster is the right solution for your organization.
