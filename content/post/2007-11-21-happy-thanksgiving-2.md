For those of you that celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, I hope that your holiday is a pleasant one. I hope that you take the time to reflect upon all the blessings that God has poured out upon you, and to be thankful for everything good in your life. I know that I am. God bless you, and happy Thanksgiving!
