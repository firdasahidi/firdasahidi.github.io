Within the last few days, VMware has released a [beta version of the VI Toolkit for Windows](http://blogs.vmware.com/vipowershell/2008/03/we-are-beta.html), a set of PowerShell cmdlets that enable users to do some very useful, very powerful things with Microsoft's new scripting language. Personally, I've never been a good programmer and so learning a new language like the PowerShell scripting language will take some time (something I have precious little of these days), but I do hope to be able to become more familiar with these tools and how to use them for my benefit and the benefit of my customers.
