In [Virtualization Short Take #2][1], I mentioned the announcement by Catbird of their HypervisorShield, and joined with Christofer Hoff in asking what it was, exactly, that Catbird was seeking to protect with this product.

Since that time, Christofer had the opportunity to speak with Michael Berman, CTO for Catbird, and get some additional information and clarification on what Catbird's new product is and isn't doing. This [clarification is available here](http://rationalsecurity.typepad.com/blog/2008/02/clarification-f.html).
