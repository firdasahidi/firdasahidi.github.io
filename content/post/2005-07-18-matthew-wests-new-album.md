I stopped by the local [LifeWay](http://www.lifewaystores.com/lwstore/) yesterday to spend a gift card the kids had purchased for me as a Father's Day gift. While I was there, I found that the latest album from [Matthew West](http://www.matthewwest.com/), _History_, was available, so I picked up a copy. Good stuff! I'd heard the latest single from the album, "Next Thing You Know," on the radio, but as I was listening to it again this morning on the way to church God really blessed me again. It's funny how a song that maybe you've heard a dozen times or more can really touch your heart. To me, that's just another indicator that no matter how much we think we know God, there's still more to Him than we could ever imagine.

Anyway, go grab a copy of _History_ and listen to it. I think the Lord will really speak to you.
