Those of you that reviewed my Tech-Ed schedule saw a session called "Do These 10 Things Now or Get 0wn3d!". This was an entertaining session by Steve Riley on security. I'm sorry, but there's no liveblog for that session. I had to eat lunch, and I haven't yet figured out how to eat lunch, liveblog, and pay attention to the session at the same time. Tips for doing all three are welcome in the comments.
