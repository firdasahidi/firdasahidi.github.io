Well, barring some unforeseen disaster or God leading us otherwise, my wife and I are going to Stockholm, Sweden, around Labor Day. A good friend of mine is getting married and we've been invited to the wedding. It's a bit scary, as the only foreign country I have ever visited was Mexico, and that was to a high-traffic tourist area. Somehow, I don't think that thousands of Americans visit Stockholm in September every year. Anybody know any Swedish?
