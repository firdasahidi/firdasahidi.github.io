I first started getting into [VMware][link-1] around 2003, possibly earlier (I can't recall exactly when it was). I remember thinking that VMware's impact on the industry was going to be significant, and I wanted to be part of this industry change. I was right---virtualization like what VMware offers has fundamentally changed the industry. However, just as technology evolves, technology careers must evolve as well. Specifically, my technology career must change and grow. It's time to evolve.<!--more-->

This need to evolve has been building for a couple years. You've probably observed that the amount of VMware-centric content produced here on the site has slowly been replaced by topics like Linux, [Docker][link-2], [Vagrant][link-3], [Terraform][link-4], [AWS][link-5], [Azure][link-6], and others. These topics represent where I think my next period of growth and change resides, and after a couple years of slow growth in these areas it's now time to "put the pedal to the metal" and accelerate things.

As of this coming Friday, March 30, 2018, I will be leaving VMware after a little over 5 years with the company. My time with VMware (as an employee) has been an amazing adventure. I'm thankful to Brad Hedlund for his Twitter DM asking me, "Would you be interested in talking to Martin Casado?", and I'm thankful to Martin for giving me an opportunity to be part of the network virtualization vanguard at VMware. I've met some incredible people, learned many things, worked with amazing teams, and contributed to important projects.

Not only am I leaving VMware as an employee, but I'm also leaving VMware as a focus area. After about 15 years of being focused almost exclusively on VMware products and platforms, I'm stepping away from VMware to focus and concentrate on a new technology direction.

I'll talk more about my new focus next week when I announce where I'm headed following my departure from VMware. Naturally, this decision to focus on a new technology direction means some changes. Often, in order to say "yes," one must also say "no." In this particular case, in order to say "yes" to focusing on a new technology direction, I must say "no" to being well-versed in VMware's products and platforms. Similarly, in order to say "yes" to being an engaged member of a new technical community, I must say "no" to being closely involved in the VMware community.

It is, perhaps, the VMware community that I will miss the most; it's been part of my professional life for more than a few years. So, what does this mean? Moving forward, it won't make sense for me to be involved in user group events, and I probably won't continue to be a vExpert (2018 is already in the bag, marking a ten-year run, but 2019 probably won't happen---and that's OK). I don't foresee maintaining my VCDX. These are fully expected consequences of switching my focus away from VMware's platforms. Although I expect I will always have friends within the community, it simply doesn't make sense to be as active and involved as I have been in the past.

While I am saddened by the thought of not being so involved in the VMware community, I am encouraged by the opportunity to build relationships in a new community. I'm hopeful that I can make a positive impact in some small way. That's my goal, anyway.

It probably goes without saying, but I'll continue to publish content here, although the content will (naturally) shift even further away from VMware-related topics. What can you expect to see? [My list of 2018 projects/goals][xref-1] provides a few clues. I'll continue to remain active [on Twitter][link-7], and there are a few different Slack communities where you're likely to spot me as well.

Change is an integral part of life, and it's an integral part of every person's career (or should be, anyway!). The time has come to embrace this change and make the most of the opportunity. It's time to evolve. Exciting times are ahead!
