On the heels of [being selected][1] to speak at [Virtualization Congress 2009](http://www.virtualizationcongress.com/), I'm also very excited to announce that I will be writing a book!

This is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity. (Although I suspect I may change my tune after everything is said and done!) While I can't disclose any of the details around the book just yet, I will say that it is virtualization-related and---quite obviously---I'm hoping it will be a tremendous success. We're shooting for publication in the first half of this year.

If there are any experienced authors out there who are interested in sharing some tips and tricks with this first-time author, please drop me a line. I'd certainly appreciate any advice or suggestions.
