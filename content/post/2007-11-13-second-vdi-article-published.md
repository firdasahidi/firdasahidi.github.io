Another VDI article I wrote has been published by [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/):

>In my last article on virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), I discussed the three main components of a VDI solution: the virtualization servers and supporting infrastructure, the hosted operating system (OS) instances, and the connection broker. In this article, I'd like to take a more detailed look at the connection broker and some of the functionality that brokers provide in a VDI deployment.
