[DockerCon EU 18][link-1] is set to kick off in early December (December 3-5, to be precise!) in Barcelona, Spain. Thanks to Docker's commitment to attendee families---something for which I have and will continue to commend them---DockerCon will offer both childcare (as they have in years past) _and_ spouse/partner activities via Spousetivities. Let me just say: Spousetivities in Barcelona rocks. Crystal lines up a great set of activities that really cannot be beat.<!--more-->

Here's some details on what's available in Barcelona for DockerCon EU 18:

* On Monday, December 3, there will be a private tour of Costa Brava and Girona. Girona is an extremely well-preserved medieval walled city dating back to the first century! If you're a fan of history, this is one not to miss. The tour will, of course, include an amazing lunch in a traditional local restaurant.
* Tuesday, December 4, participants will do a combined Barcelona city tour along with a visit to the famous La Sagrada Familia. The city tour will include stops to sample a wide variety of tapas in local venues. You'll also get to visit La Sagrada Familia, which is a definite must-see if you've never visited before.
* Wrapping up the events on Wednesday, December 5, Spousetivities will go to Montserrat. This impressive monastery is a fantastic place to visit, full of history and culture. Also found at Montserrat is "Moreneta de Montserrat," one of the famous black Madonnas of Europe. The tour will also include a fantastic lunch of local Catalan cuisine, followed by a visit to a nearby medieval village for more historic architecture.

For this event, Docker is stepping up their support of Spousetivities by _integrating Spousetivities registration directly into their conference registration._ So, if you're a DockerCon attendee and you'd like to add activities for your spouse or significant other, you can do so directly from within your DockerCon registration. [This page][link-2] has more details on the activities and links to update your DockerCon registration with one or more activities.

(BTW, if you need information on childcare, see [here][link-3].)

The pricing for Spousetivities is also pretty impressive: only 150 euros a day, and if you pay for 2 days you get a third day at no additional cost! That's right---150 euros for any one day of activities, or 300 euros for all three days of activities! Visit [the DockerCon Spousetivities landing page][link-2] for a link to add activities to a DockerCon registration---and hurry before the events sell out!
