I'm thankful to have the opportunity to work with an amazing team. Many of my teammates also produce some very useful content via their own sites, and so I thought it might be useful to my readers to share a list of links to my teammates' blogs.<!--more-->

Without further ado, here is a list of my teammates who have a blog; each entry is a link to the respective site (these are presented in no particular order):

* [John Harris][link-1]
* [Jim Weber][link-2]
* [Josh Rosso][link-3]
* [Alexander Brand][link-4]
* [Nicholas Lane][link-5]
* [Dan Finneran][link-6]
* [Hart Hoover][link-7]
* [Duffie Cooley][link-8]
* [Stephen Augustus][link-9]
* [Timmy Carr][link-10]
* [Olive Power][link-12]
* [Carl Danley][link-11] _(not fully live yet)_
* [Koushik Radhakrishnan][link-13] _(not fully live yet)_

I know I've gained valuable insight from some of their content, and I hope you do as well.
