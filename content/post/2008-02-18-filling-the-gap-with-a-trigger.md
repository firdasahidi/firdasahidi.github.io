In part 2 of my informal discussion about [getting things done with my Mac][1], I mentioned that I needed a way to invoke an AppleScript from within [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswire/). I was already using Mail Act-On and an AppleScript to easily move information from Mail.app into [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/), and had a similar AppleScript for NNW but no easy way to invoke it.

It wasn't until late last night that I realized I already had a solution for the problem I'd been describing. I'd been searching for some way to quickly and easily invoke an AppleScript from within NetNewsWire---why not just use a Quicksilver Trigger?

I already use Quicksilver for tons of other things: accessing my [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/) bookmarks (would love to be able to get to my Camino history...hint, hint); launching applications; getting information on a contact in the Address Book; even launching other scripts for various tasks. Why not leverage Quicksilver for this as well?

Just a few minutes later---the process only took a few minutes in the Quicksilver Preferences pane to configure the trigger---and I was quickly and easily moving information from NetNewsWire to OmniFocus.

Thank goodness for Quicksilver!
