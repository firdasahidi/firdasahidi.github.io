I stumbled across [this post](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2008/07/15/im-honored/) by Duncan over at Yellow Bricks about his inclusion in a [recent Top 10 list](http://vmware-land.com/Top_10_Lists.html) by Eric Siebert over at VMware-land. The new Top 10 list is "Top 10 blogs that VMware administrators must read." This list is a regular "Who's Who" list of well-known bloggers like Mike Laverick, Eric Sloof, Christofer Hoff, and others. Lo and behold, I find out that I'm on the list as well! And at #2, no less!

Thanks to all my readers and to everyone who has helped me along the way. It's been a tremendous pleasure writing this blog and I'm looking forward to many more posts in the future!
