I use Spotlight comments for Finder items as a way to help tag files and folders for easier searching. In the past, I used an Automator workflow, saved as a Finder plug-in, to quickly and easily tag files and folders. Unfortunately, since the upgrade to Leopard, that workflow has stopped working. I even recreated the workflow entirely and it still doesn't work. Has anyone else run into this kind of issue? If so, did you ever find a workaround?
