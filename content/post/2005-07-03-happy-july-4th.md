For those readers in the US, I want to wish you a very enjoyable and very happy Fourth of July! As we celebrate another year of independence and freedom, take some time to remember those soldiers fighting overseas to preserve our freedom here as well as to give others the same kind of freedom. Also take the time to thank the one true Author of freedom, and that is God. May God bless each of you, and may God bless America!
