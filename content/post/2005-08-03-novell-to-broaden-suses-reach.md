I've always heard good things about SuSE, but have never had the opportunity to work with it in greater depth. Now, [Novell](http://www.novell.com) has [detailed its plans](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1843097,00.asp) to open SuSE to community development in a manner similar to the approach used by [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) with its [Fedora Project](http://www.fedora.redhat.com).

I think it's a good thing. Anything that Novell can do to broaden the reach and influence of SuSE will certainly help both Novell and the SuSE Linux distribution itself. As it gains more attention, people will be more likely to develop _on_ and _for_ SuSE.
