This month---May 2018---marks **thirteen years** that I've been generating content here on this site. It's been a phenomenal 13 years, and I've enjoyed the opportunity to share information with readers around the world. To celebrate, I thought I'd do a quick "Posts from the Past" and highlight some content from previous years. Enjoy!<!--more-->

## May 2017

A year ago, I touched on the topic of [using a `Makefile` with Markdown documents][xref-1] to help streamline the process of generating various output formats.

I also explored the use of [custom SSH configurations with SSH bastion hosts][xref-2] and uncovered a very basic (but important) error I'd previously overlooked.

## May 2016

Two years ago in May I was [using Terraform to build an etcd v2 cluster on OpenStack][xref-3].

## May 2015

Three years ago, I was doing a lot of work in my home lab, automating the setup of physical hosts. That led to a post on [a fully automated Ubuntu install][xref-4], which was also related to this post on [using an Apt proxy][xref-5] (via `apt-cacher-ng`).

## May 2014

Four years ago, I shared [some useful Markdown tools for macOS][xref-6]. Of those tools, I still use `pandoc` pretty extensively.

## May 2013

Five years ago, I was exploring Open vSwitch (OVS), and wrote some stuff that is still applicable even today. For example, this post on [examining Open vSwitch traffic patterns][xref-7] is, in my opinion, core to understanding how OVS works in various configurations (particularly with tunnels).

## May 2011

May 2012 was a slow month, so we'll skip back to May 2011, where I was [tackling inaccuracies regarding stretched clusters and long-distance vMotion][xref-8] while also [introducing folks to Quicksilver][xref-9] (is this app even still around?).

## May 2006

Going _way, way back,_ we come to May 2006---only a year after this site was launched. Twelve years ago, I was exploring [the automation of Active Directory security groups][xref-10] and [the automation of Active Directory account maintenance][xref-11]. I guess I've been exploring automation for longer than I thought!

Here's hoping you enjoyed this little trip back into the archives. Maybe you found something useful you can still put to use!
