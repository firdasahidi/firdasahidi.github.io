Rynardt Spies of [VirtualVCP](http://www.virtualvcp.com/) hit me up via e-mail yesterday to let me know about a new virtualization wiki he's launched. It's called [Vi-Pedia](http://www.vi-pedia.com/Welcome).

The idea behind Vi-Pedia is to gather information on virtualization technologies in one place for easier reference. Clearly, being a wiki it won't succeed without lots of community participation, so I thought I'd put up a quick mention of the new site to help spread the word.

Free free to jump over to [Vi-Pedia](http://www.vi-pedia.com/Welcome) and help contribute!
