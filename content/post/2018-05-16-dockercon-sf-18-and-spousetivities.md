[DockerCon SF 18][link-1] is set to kick off in San Francisco at the Moscone Center from June 12 to June 15. This marks the return of DockerCon to San Francisco after being held in other venues for the last couple of years. Also returning to San Francisco is [Spousetivities][link-4], which has organized activities for spouses, significant others/domestic partners, friends, and family members traveling with conference attendees!<!--more-->

[Registration is open][link-2] right now, so hurry on over and sign up for one or more activities. What's that---you're wondering what's been planned? Here's a quick overview:

* The activities kick off on Tuesday, June 12, with a walking food tour of North Beach and Little Italy. The tour includes great information about the city and the venues where you'll be sampling some great food and drinks, including coffee, Italian soda, focaccia, and chocolates! Yum! This event will depart from and return to the Park Central Hotel.
* On Wednesday, June 13, Spousetivities has arranged for private transportation to the Sonoma Valley for some wine tastings! You'll visit a couple different wineries and get to enjoy lunch in Sonoma. This event will wrap up back at the InterContinental around 6pm (departs from the same location at 8:30am).
* Finally, on Thursday, June 14, is a tour of the city and a trip to Muir Woods. Participants will leave the InterContinental at 8:30am and get to see _all_ the major highlights of San Francisco before having lunch in Sausalito followed by a trip to Muir Woods. The tour will return to the InterContinental around 5:30pm.

Pricing for all these events has been drastically reduced thanks to support from [Docker][link-3] (kudos to them for sponsoring work/life balance!). Thanks to their financial support of Spousetivities, participants save between $125 and $175 per activity compared to retail pricing. Participants can save _even more_ by using the new 3-day discount pass, which provides access to all three days of activities at a phenomenal discount (only $300 for all three days!).

Please make note of the departure locations each day! Tuesday departs from the Park Central Hotel, while Wednesday and Thursday will depart from the InterContinental. Plan accordingly!

It's quite possible that these activities will sell out, so don't wait---head on over to [the registration page][link-2] and sign up sooner rather than later.
