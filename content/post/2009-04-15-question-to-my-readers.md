One of the things that I thought might be interesting, perhaps even useful, to the readers would be to present various views on virtualization, cloud computing, etc., from industry executives. My first foray into this sort of thing was the recent [e-mail interview][1] with Surgient CTO, Dave Malcolm.

While I might think it is interesting or cool or useful, there are about 5,000 of you out there that may have a very different view. So, in the interest of trying to make this site as useful and informative as it can be, I'd like to know what you think. Is this idea a good idea? Do you find it interesting, informative? Or was it too "salesy"? I don't want my site being turned into a platform for executives to just stand up and plug their products. Is there a better way I could do this, perhaps a different format? Should we require that people _not_ plug their own products at all?

I'd love to hear your thoughts.
