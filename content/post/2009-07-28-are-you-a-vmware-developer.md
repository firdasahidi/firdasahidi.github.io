Are you a VMware developer? If so, you should be looking at attending [VMware Technology Exchange Developer Day](http://communities.vmware.com/community/developer/techexchange). Like a few other bloggers, VMware contacted me asking for some help getting word out about this event, which is a developer-focused event tailored for application builders using VMware platforms.

This [VMware blog post](http://blogs.vmware.com/developer/2009/07/5-reasons-to-attend-technology-exchange-developer-day.html) provides some reasons why you should attend, and a session schedule is [available here](http://blogs.vmware.com/developer/2009/07/vmware-technology-exchange-developer-day-sessions-schedule.html).
