At least it can't be said that I only identify and write about Microsoft-related security flaws. (I'd like to not have to write about security flaws at all, but that doesn't look like it's going to happen.)

[This Zlib flaw](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1834632,00.asp) affects Linux, BSD, and even some Microsoft products. It's an equal opportunity security flaw.

As described in the linked article above, patches have already been released for a number of products affected by the Zlib flaw.
