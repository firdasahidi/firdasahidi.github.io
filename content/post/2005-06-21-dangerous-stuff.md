The Internet grows more dangerous every day. Why?  Well, have a look at this [recent eWeek article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1829744,00.asp) and this [slightly older eWeek article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1818369,00.asp) and you'll see what I mean.

[Spyware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware/) acting like [root kits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_kit/)? [Viruses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus/) taking on root kit features and able to hide their processes? This is scary stuff. When one of these malicious programs exploits a vulnerability in your web browser, you could get infected and not even know it. And if that application starts using I/O blocking to hide its processes and NTFS data streams to hide files inside other (legitimate) files, you're really in trouble.

I know that [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) may only be more secure than [Microsoft Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) because not as many people use it, but the end result is the same. If you use Windows, at least protect yourself---don't use Internet Explorer (use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)), stay up to date on patches (visit Windows Update regularly), use an anti-virus application (and keep it updated as well), and use a good anti-spyware program (there are several, take your pick). You'll be glad you did.
