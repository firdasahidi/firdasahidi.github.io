Only one week remains until [Spousetivities][link-1] kicks off in [Vancouver at the OpenStack Summit][link-2]! If you are traveling to the Summit with a spouse, significant other, family member, or friend, I'd encourage you to take a look at the great activities Crystal has arranged during the Summit.<!--more-->

Here's a quick sneak peek at what's planned:

* On Monday, May 21, Spousetivities attendees will enjoy a tour of the highlights of Vancouver (including things like Stanley Park, Gastown, Chinatown, and Granville Island Public Market), followed by fun at the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park. (If for no other reason, you'll want to attend this to see Crystal face her fear of heights and suspension bridges!)
* On Tuesday, May 22, Spousetivities is off to Whistler Village. Along the way, see wonderful sights like Howe Sound, Britannia Beach, and Shannon Falls. Then you'll get to ride the Sea to Sky Gondola up to Squamish for an adventure-filled time.
* On Wednesday, May 23, the activities wrap up with a wine tour. This will include tastings at three beautiful wineries and a lovely picnic lunch at one of the venues.

All of these tours includes private transportation, and the pricing for each of the events is reduced by about 25% from retail pricing. Participants can save more money by using the all-new Full Event Discount Pass, which gets entry to all three activities at an additional discount. Check out [the Spousetivities registration page][link-1] for more details and pricing, or to sign up.
