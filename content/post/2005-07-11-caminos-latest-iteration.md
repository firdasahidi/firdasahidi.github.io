I've been using [Camino 0.9a1](http://www.caminobrowser.org), the latest version of the native [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) browser, for the last few days. I have to say that I am impressed. I like the new features on the Go menu that shows the most recently visited websites; this makes it easier to flip back to a site than having to switch to the "Bookmarks" view. The new tab bar is much better as well; I couldn't stand the old one.

The [CamiTools](http://www.nada.de/mac/camitools/) add-ons for Camino 0.9a1 are also excellent; I'm using both CamiOptions as well as CamiFlash.

If you are using Camino now, you should give this new version a spin. You'll be glad you did.
