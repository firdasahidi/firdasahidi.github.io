David Davis (of [Train Signal](http://www.trainsignal.com/) and [VMwareVideos.com](http://www.vmwarevideos.com/)) was kind enough to record my stretched clusters presentation at the Carolinas VMware User Summit back in May. That video recording has now made its way online, so if you are interested in watching/hearing the presentation you're in luck! I've embedded the YouTube video below, or you can follow [this link](http://youtu.be/JhEVIFFYqeA) to view it at the YouTube site.

If you're also interested in seeing the slide deck that accompanied my presentation, that's available via [this blog post][1].

Enjoy!

Many thanks to David Davis and Train Signal for recording the session and making the recording available.

**UPDATE:** The embedded video was converted to a link in the blog migration that occurred at the end of 2014.
