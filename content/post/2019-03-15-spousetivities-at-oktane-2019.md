It should come as no surprise to anyone that I'm a huge supporter of [Spousetivities][link-1], and not just because it was my wife, [Crystal Lowe][link-2], who launched this movement. What started as the gathering of a few folks at VMworld 2008 has grown over the last 11 years, and this year marks the appearance of Spousetivities at an entirely new conference: [Oktane 2019][link-3]!<!--more-->

Oktane is the conference for [Okta][link-4], a well-known provider of identity services, and the event is happening in San Francisco from April 1 through April 4 (at Moscone West). This year, Okta is bringing Spousetivities in to add activities for those traveling to San Francisco with conference attendees.

What sort of activities are planned? [The Oktane19 Spousetivities landing page][link-5] has full details, but here's a quick peek:

* A wine tour in Sonoma/Napa with private transportation (lunch is included, of course!)
* A walking food tour of San Francisco combined with a bus tour of the city and tickets to [Beach Blanket Babylon][link-6]
* A whale watching tour

...and more!

If you're attending Oktane19 and are bringing along a spouse, domestic partner, family member, or even just a friend---I'd definitely recommend signing them up for Spousetivities. What's particularly cool about the activities at Oktane is that some activities---the wine tour and the walking tour---are available on Sunday, March 31, for folks arriving into San Francisco early. Nice!

To sign someone up for the activities, head on over to [the Oktane 19 Spousetivities landing page][link-5]. Enjoy!
