Some of you may have noticed the new "I Recommend VMware Workstation" and "I Recommend VMware Fusion" icons at the bottom of the sidebar on the right. I hadn't written specifically about these, but thought it might be a good idea to mention them. This is part of a new referral program that VMware is testing. If you are at all interested in using either of these programs and haven't already purchased them, please consider using the links from this site. Thanks!
