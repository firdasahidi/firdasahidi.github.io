As I'm very sure has been copiously reported elsewhere, on Monday Microsoft [released to manufacturing Windows Server 2008](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2008/02/04/windows-server-2008-rtm.aspx). Also on Monday, Microsoft [RTM'ed Windows Vista SP1](http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/02/04/announcing-the-rtm-of-windows-vista-sp1.aspx).

According to Microsoft's published roadmaps, the RTM of Windows Server 2008 signals the start of the 180 day countdown to the final release of Hyper-V, Microsoft's hypervisor. Microsoft has included a beta build of Hyper-V in the RTM build of Windows Server 2008, but it's the same build released in December so there's nothing new there.

I hope VMware's ready...the virtualization landscape is about to get a lot more competitive.
