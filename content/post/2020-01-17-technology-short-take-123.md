Welcome to Technology Short Take #123, the first of 2020! I hope that everyone had a wonderful holiday season, but now it's time to jump back into the fray with a collection of technical articles from around the Internet. Here's hoping that I found something useful for you!<!--more-->

## Networking

* Eric Sloof [mentions][link-27] the NSX-T load balancing encyclopedia (found [here][link-28]), which intends to be an authoritative resource to NSX-T load balancing configuration and management.
* David Gee has an interesting set of articles exploring service function chaining in service mesh environments ([part 1][link-30], [part 2][link-31], [part 3][link-32], and [part 4][link-33]).

## Servers/Hardware

* Frank Denneman has a nice article aimed at helping readers understand [PCIe device to NUMA Node Locality][link-1].
* Giuliano Bertello [introduces PowerVCF][link-6], a PowerCLI module aimed at interacting with the SDDC Manager and VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack. (If you're not familiar with VCF, see [here][link-7].)
* [This][link-8] is pricey, but I can't say I don't want one.
* James Hamilton is back with a post on [the AWS Graviton2 ARM processors][link-11].

## Security

* On January 13, Brian Krebs [discussed][link-12] the critical flaw (a vulnerability in `crypt32.dll`, a core Windows cryptographic component) that was rumored to be fixed the next day (January 14) on the first "Patch Tuesday" of 2020. The next day, [the Microsoft Security Response Center confirmed the vulnerability][link-13]. Time to get patching, folks!
* It's good to see 1Password [add support for U2F security keys][link-24] for logging into your 1Password.com account via a web browser. Now I really want to see hardware security key support in the desktop and mobile apps!

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* The Grafana folks have [introduced Tanka][link-2], a new tool aimed a simplifying the task of managing Kubernetes manifests. While I'm sure that the use of `jsonnet` _may_ appeal to some users, I'm not sure it's going to appeal to "the masses," so to speak.
* Eric Shanks has a good walkthrough on [setting up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS with the AWS cloud provider enabled][link-3]. It's a nice companion/supplement/partner article to [my own post on the same topic][xref-1] (which, although it specifically mentions 1.15, should still work with 1.16 and 1.17 as well).
* My colleague Dan Finneran discusses [designing and building HA Kubernetes clusters on bare metal][link-5].
* Here's [a list of Kubernetes tools][link-10].
* HashiCorp recently announced the expansion of their Terraform Module Registry to include providers (and renaming the service to the Terraform Registry). Read more details [here][link-19].
* Sam McGeown [explains][link-21] how he uses GitLab pipelines to deploy his Hugo-based site to AWS. Oh, and you might also enjoy Nicolas Fr√§nkel's post outlining his [blogging stack and publishing process][link-22].
* How about a bash "wrapper" for working with AWS resources from the command line? [See here][link-23].
* Chris Evans posits that [AWS is not building hybrid cloud][link-26], and I must say I can't really disagree with his reasoning.

## Operating Systems/Applications

* As of January 14, Windows 7 is now End of Life (EOL), as pointed out [here][link-14] by Sergiu Gatlan.
* [This][link-15] is kind of cool.
* Casey McMullen takes readers through [a step-by-step guide to use Docker containers to do local development for PHP, MySQL, and Redis][link-16]. Readers can, of course, extrapolate from the concepts presented here to include other development environments. If you're a non-developer wondering why containers are getting so much attention, read this article and try to see it from a developer's perspective.
* Giovanni Collazo shares [how to configure iTerm2 to recognize macOS-specific keyboard shortcuts][link-18].
* Steve Sloka [talks about new features in the Contour 1.1 release][link-20].
* I'm just getting started learning Golang, and already other folks [are talking about moving to Rust][link-25]. I'm so far behind.

## Storage

Nothing this time around; I'll try to find some content for next time!

## Virtualization

* William Lam keeps everyone updated regarding [running ESXi on the 2019 Mac Pro][link-29].

## Career/Soft Skills

* Scott Driver [talks][link-4] about "the vCommunity" and some of the benefits that can be had, career-wise, from actively participating. Although Scott's article focuses on the VMware-centric community, this is true (in my opinion) of many different communities, including various open source communities---and, to be frank, the physical communities in which we live and work.
* Now that I've moved back onto macOS (see [here][xref-2] for the explanation), I'm also taking OmniFocus back up, and so I found [this article][link-9] on using OmniFocus' new Tags functionality helpful.
* Thomas Maurer has some great tips for [creating technical demos and presentations][link-17], although (I guess somewhat understandably given he works for Microsoft) the tips are a tad Windows-centric.

I guess that's all for now! Thanks for reading, and again I hope that you found something useful here. If you have feedback, suggestions for improvement, or just want to say hi, feel free to [hit me up on Twitter][link-99]. Thanks!
