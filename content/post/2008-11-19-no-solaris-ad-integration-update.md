I'm sorry, folks, but I'm not going to have the time or the resources to publish an update to my [existing instructions][1] for integrating Solaris 10 into Active Directory. Quite some time ago I had posted that I planned on creating an update to the original instructions so as to incorporate [some lessons learned][2], but it keeps get pushed aside for other tasks that are more important and more relevant to my day-to-day work. Rather than keep readers hanging on for something that will likely never appear, I'd rather just be upfront and frank about the situation. As much as I'd love to spend some time working on the Solaris-AD integration situation and documenting my findings, I just don't have the time. Sorry.
