I recently had the honor of participating in an e-mail interview with OdinJobs regarding virtualization and how to "break into" the virtualization industry. My fellow cohorts in this e-mail interview were [Bob Plankers](http://lonesysadmin.net) and [Martin MacLeod](http://www.bladewatch.com). The interview questions focused on things like the best way for a sysadmin to get started with virtualization, what skills may be vendor-specific or not, and where virtualization may be headed. It was pretty interesting to participate, and it's even more interesting to see how Bob and Martin responded to the questions.

You can read the full interview [here at OdinJobs](http://www.odinjobs.com/blogs/careers/entry/virtualization_how_and_why_you).
