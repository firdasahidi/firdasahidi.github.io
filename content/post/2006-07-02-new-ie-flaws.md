In addition to the announcement of a [new "trojan horse" for Mac OS X][1], a couple new flaws were uncovered and disclosed for Internet Explorer in the last few days as well.

According to eWeek, a security researcher has uncovered [two new flaws for Internet Explorer](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1984286,00.asp). I have not been able to locate any additional details on the more critical of the two flaws, but the lesser flaw has a [Secunia advisory](http://secunia.com/advisories/20825/) posted.

If you use Internet Explorer, exercise caution. Better yet, switch to Firefox.
