I'm very excited to announce that I have been invited to speak at [Virtualization Congress 2009](http://www.virtualizationcongress.com/)! In fact, I was even lucky enough to make the Virtualization Congress front page as a "featured speaker." Cool!

Virtualization Congress is happening on May 4-7 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. It's being co-hosted with Citrix Synergy, which is going on at the same time. As far as I know, Virtualization Congress is the only independent, virtualization-centered conference, so it would be nice to see it be a great success. Given the all-star lineup that Alessandro is creating---Ron Oglesby, Christofer Hoff, Stephen Beaver, Ruben Spruijt, and Cody Bunch, to name a few---this is shaping up to be quite the event. If there's any way you can make it, I have a feeling you won't be disappointed.
