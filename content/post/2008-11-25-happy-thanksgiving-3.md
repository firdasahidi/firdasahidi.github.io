For those readers who celebrate Thanksgiving, I'd like to extend to you my warmest wishes for a very pleasant and very restful Thanksgiving holiday. I am very thankful for the blessings that have been bestowed upon me; despite whatever problems I may be having, it could certainly be worse.

(Yes, I know the holiday isn't until Thursday, but I'm leaving with my family for a short out-of-town vacation and wanted to go ahead and wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving before leaving.)

To those readers who do not celebrate Thanksgiving but do celebrate something similar, I wish you a very enjoyable holiday as well.
