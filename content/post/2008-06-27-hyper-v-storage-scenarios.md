Like everyone else in the virtualization world (except for perhaps the folks in Palo Alto, CA), there's a lot of Hyper-V stuff crossing in front of me.

This time it's an article on [storage options for Hyper-V](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2008/02/14/storage-options-for-windows-server-2008-s-hyper-v.aspx), written by Jose Barreto. (You'll recall that I [referenced Jose's clustering article][1] a few days ago.) Out of the wide variety of blogs coming out of Microsoft, Jose's is one that I have really, truly found informative and helpful. The home page for his blog is [here](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/default.aspx).

Jose also wrote a [follow-up article on Hyper-V's storage options](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2008/03/06/more-on-storage-options-for-windows-server-2008-s-hyper-v.aspx) where he discussed booting from iSCSI.

Great work, Jose! Keep it coming.
