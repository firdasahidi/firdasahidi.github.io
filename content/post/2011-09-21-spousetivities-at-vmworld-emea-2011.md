In case you haven't heard already, the [registration page for Spousetivities at VMworld EMEA 2011](http://spousetivitiesvmworldemea2011.eventbrite.com/) is live and open for sign-ups! Crystal made [the announcement about Spousetivities at VMworld EMEA](http://spousetivities.com/2011/09/spousetivities-returns-to-vmworld-emea/) on her site already, but I wanted to include it here as well so that everyone knew. Most of the activities sold out at VMworld US in Las Vegas, and Crystal's hoping for similar success this year in Copenhagen. If you are going to be attending VMworld EMEA in Copenhagen and bringing your spouse/partner/significant other/family member, here are some of the things that are planned:

* Castle tour
* Tour of City Hall Square
* Canal tour
* Visit to Malmo, Sweden

Full details are available on the [registration page](http://spousetivitiesvmworldemea2011.eventbrite.com/).
