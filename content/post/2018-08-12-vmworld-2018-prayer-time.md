title: VMworld 2018 Prayer Time

For the last several years, I've organized a brief morning prayer time at VMworld. This year, I won't be at the conference, but I'd like to help coordinate a time for believers to meet nevertheless. So, if you're a Christian interested in gathering together with other Christians for a brief time of prayer, here are the details.<!--more-->

**What:** A brief time of prayer

**Where:** Mandalay Bay Convention Center, level 1 (same level as the food court), at the bottom of the escalators heading upstairs (over near the business center)

**When:** Monday 8/27 through Thursday 8/30 at 7:45am (this should give everyone enough time to grab breakfast before the keynotes start at 9am)

**Who:** All courteous attendees are welcome, but please note this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centric activity (I encourage believers of other faiths/religions to organize equivalent activities)

**Why:** To spend a few minutes in prayer over the day, the conference, the attendees, and each other

You don't need to RSVP or anything like that, although you're welcome to if you'd like (just [hit me up on Twitter][link-2]). As I mentioned, I won't be at the conference, so I'll ask folks who have attended prayer time in previous years to help take the lead in my absence. (There's a growing chance I'll be in town but not attending the conference; if that works out, I'll be sure to join for prayer in the morning.)

There's no need to bring anything other than an open heart, your faith, and your willingness to display that faith in front of others. The gathering is very casual---we'll gather together, share a few prayer requests and needs, and then give folks the opportunity to pray as they feel led. If you don't like praying out loud in public, that's cool; we're not going to force anyone. We just want to give believers the opportunity to strengthen one another in the faith.

I hope that plenty of believers at the conference get the opportunity to join for prayer. Reach out to other Christians you may know and tell them about morning prayer at VMworld!
