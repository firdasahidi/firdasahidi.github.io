Apparently, Microsoft's [public statement](http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/claria_letter.mspx) regarding the downgrade of Claria software in their anti-spyware product (which now recommends that users ignore the Claria software instead of remove it) isn't sitting well.

In [this article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1835770,00.asp) at _eWeek_, a number of spyware experts call Microsoft's explanation less than satisfactory.  [Ed Bott](http://www.edbott.com/weblog/archives/000844.html), [Ben Edelman](http://www.benedelman.org/news/063005-1.html), and others have all commented on Microsoft's explanation. The overwhelming consensus is that users don't trust Microsoft to be honest. And why should they? Unfortunately, Microsoft has placed itself in an unenviable position, and only by being completely squeaky clean and transparent will it be able to avoid a backlash over actions such as this.
