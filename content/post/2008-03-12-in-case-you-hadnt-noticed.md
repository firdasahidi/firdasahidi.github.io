In case you hadn't noticed, some of my virtualization-related content is now being aggregated by Doug Brown over at [DABCC.com](http://dabcc.com/). I'm honored that Doug is including my content. So, if you haven't visited DABCC.com recently, hop over there right now. I'm confident you'll find it as useful a resource as I do.
