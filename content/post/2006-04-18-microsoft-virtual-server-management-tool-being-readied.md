According to [CRN](http://www.crn.com/), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) is readying a management tool for [Microsoft Virtual Server](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/default.mspx). This tool would help fill a serious gap in Microsoft's server virtualization lineup.

>"Today, the problem with Microsoft Virtual Server is the missing management tool for it overall. Carmine is the code name for that management tool," said one source familiar with Microsoft's plans. "Microsoft has to play catch-up to VMware's management console."

[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) already has a powerful virtual server management tool, [VirtualCenter](http://www.vmware.com/products/vc/), and technology for dynamically moving virtual machines between host servers with no downtime---technology called [VMotion](http://www.vmware.com/products/vc/vmotion.html). Microsoft's rumored product, code-named "Carmine," would provide some of the basic functionality of VirtualCenter, but not all of it. VMware will still have a lead on the management side.
