I just finished installing the latest version (3.7) of [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/), and I was reminded of just how different OpenBSD and Linux really are. Those on the "outside" just see them as Unix-like operating systems, but they really are much more different than you might expect. I'm no expert in either (I just dabble), but the differences are even evident to me. I haven't yet had the opportunity to experiment with [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) or [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/), so I don't know if these differences are particular to OpenBSD or to all BSDs when compared to Linux.

In any case, I find that I really like OpenBSD. I think that the more that I use OpenBSD, the more ways I will find that I _can_ use OpenBSD. It won't replace Linux in my environment, but it is a very worthy addition to the network.
