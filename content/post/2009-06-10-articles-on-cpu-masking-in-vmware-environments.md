Over the last few years I've written a few articles on CPU masking within VMware environments. To make them easier to locate I wanted to bring them all together here. So, here are the links to these articles:

[Sneaking Around VMotion Limitations][1]  
[VMotion Compatibility][2]  
[More on CPU Masking][3]

Keep in mind that almost all forms of CPU masking are **_unsupported_** by VMware, so use this information at your own risk. However, in non-production environments that don't support Enhanced VMotion Compatibility (EVC), this may be your only option.
