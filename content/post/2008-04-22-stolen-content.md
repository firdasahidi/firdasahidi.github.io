It appears that some of my articles from a couple of years ago are being republished on another site without any attribution or link back to the original. That's one of the bad things about the Internet as it stands today...it's far too easy to "copy and paste" another person's material onto your own site.

If you're interested in republishing my content, just drop me a line. I'm sure we can work something out. Just don't shamelessly steal my writing.
