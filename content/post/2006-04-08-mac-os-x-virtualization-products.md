Finally! With the [introduction of Parallels Workstation for Mac OS X](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/04/parallels-launches-workstation-beta.html) (official announcement [here](http://www.parallels.com/en/news/id,8655)), Intel-based Mac owners have the ability to run unmodified instances of Linux and Windows on their Mac hardware. This has been my ["killer wish"][1] ever since the introduction of the Intel-based Macs.

In addition, [rumors are swirling](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/04/vmware-expected-to-launch-product-for.html) about the introduction of a Mac OS X-based virtualization product from market leader [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/). (Apparently it's [already running](http://www.run-virtual.com/?p=110) in labs at VMware.)

Now I _really_ wish I had a [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/)...
