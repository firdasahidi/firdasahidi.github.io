A week ago, I posted a [call for prayer][1] for my family. I appreciate the many responses that I received, and I am happy to report that the Lord has answered our prayers. Although the answer did not come in the form that I had hoped, I am still thanking God for deliverance and I am praising God for his wondrous works.

Things could have gone much, much worse in this situation, but God's power carried my family and I through this trial and I believe that our faith and our belief is stronger for it. Again, thanks to everyone who responded, and thanks to all those who lifted their voices in prayer for my family. I hope that God richly blesses each and every one of you for your compassion and concern.
