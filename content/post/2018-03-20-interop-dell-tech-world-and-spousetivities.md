Spousetivities will be present at two additional events this year---in fact, these events are only about 6 weeks away! Both [Dell Technologies World][link-1] and [Interop ITX][link-2] are in Las Vegas the last week of April (both starting April 30), and Spousetivities is running events for both conferences.<!--more-->

&lt;aside&gt;In case you're wondering why I blog about Spousetivities, it's not only because my wife runs it (seriously). It's primarily because I'm committed to supporting families, marriages, and relationships in the IT industry. IT companies ask a lot of their employees---often asking employees to give up evenings and/or weekends, or setting unfair expectations on employee responsiveness via email/Slack/IM during off-hours---so a program that enables spouses and/or significant others to join IT employees during a conference helps provide a little bit of balance, in my view.&lt;/aside&gt;

Here's a look at what's planned during these two IT conferences:

* On Monday, April 30, there's a full-day tour of Death Valley planned. This event is leaving the Mirage at 8:00 am and includes photo opportunities at Dante's View and Zabriskie Point, a scenic drive through the Artist's Pallet, and a stop at Bad Water Basin---the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere!

* On Tuesday, May 1, Spousetivities attendees will head to Zion National Park. This trip leaves early: it's departing at 7:30 am from the Mirage. Loads of stunning views make this area a photographer's paradise, and there will be walks and hikes for every fitness level.

* Wednesday, May 2, will wrap up the activities for the week with a combination tour of Hoover Dam, some ghost towns, and El Dorado Canyon. This event will leave from the Mirage at 8:00 am, and will be a full day of fun activities (including a drive along the iconic Route 66 and a drink at a saloon!).

Attendees will _**save over $60 per event**_ by signing up with Spousetivities (compared to the normal retail pricing for such events).

There are two different registration pages, although the activities and the prices are the same:

* For attendees of Dell Technologies World, register your spouse, significant other, or family member traveling with you [here][link-4].
* For attendees of Interop ITX, [register here][link-3] to have your spouse, family member, domestic partner, or significant other join the activities.

Remember: although it's called "Spousetivities" you don't have to be a spouse to participate---the activities are open to _anyone_ traveling with a conference/event attendee.
