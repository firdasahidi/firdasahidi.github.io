In reading through a pile of unread industry magazines, I came across an article by Kevin Tolly, a columnist for [Network World](http://www.networkworld.com/), titled "[Closing the door on Windows](http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2005/091205tolly.html)", that describes his switch to the Macintosh platform.

I guess my own personal switch from [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) to [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) last year was, to borrow a phrase from [Tom Yager](http://www.infoworld.com/columnists/tom_curve.html), ahead of the curve. In his article, Tolly describes the experience in these terms (all content copyright of respective holders):

>"...the bottom line is that I'm able to get my work done more efficiently with fewer crashes and have already found 'richer' programs...which I expect to offer me more than their MS Office counterparts."

While I can't vouch for the latter part of his statement (I don't use Apple's [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) suite), I can say that my own experience is much the same. The Mac's fluid UI, rock-solid BSD underpinnings, pervasive networking support, and a variety of open source applications make it possible for me to do my job in a very effective manner. That's not to say that everyone will have the same result, but it is definitely to say that the Mac is a viable alternative. It is **definitely** a viable alternative, and more and more people are discovering that fact.
