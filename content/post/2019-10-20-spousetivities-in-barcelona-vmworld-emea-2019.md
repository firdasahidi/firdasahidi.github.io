title: Spousetivities in Barcelona at VMworld EMEA 2019

Barcelona is probably my favorite city in Europe---which works out well, since VMware seems to have settled on Barcelona at the destination for VMworld EMEA. VMworld is back in Barcelona again this year, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to attend. VMworld in Barcelona wouldn't be the same without Spousetivities, though, and I'm happy to report that Spousetivities _will_ be in Barcelona. In fact, [registration is already open][link-1]!<!--more-->

If you're bringing along a spouse, significant other, boyfriend/girlfriend, or just some family members, you owe it to them to look into Spousetivities. You'll be able to focus at the conference knowing that your loved one(s) are not only safe, but enjoying some amazing activities in and around Barcelona. Here's a quick peek at what Crystal and her team have lined up this year:

* A wine tour of the Penedes region (southwest of Barcelona)---attendees will get to see some amazing wineries not frequented by tourists!
* A walking tour of Barcelona
* A tapas cooking class
* A fantastic walking tour of Costa Brava, Pals, and Girona
* A sailing tour (it's a 3 hour tour, but it won't end up like Gilligan's)

Lunch and private transportation are included for all activities, and all activities will depart from the conference center. Times are listed on [the registration site][link-1].

It's worth noting---even though I've said it before---that these activities are **not** your run-of-the-mill tourist activities. These are custom activities not available to the general public, specially arranged for Spousetivities participants.

Prices for all these activities are reduced thanks to [Veeam][link-2]'s sponsorship, and to help make things even more affordable there is a Full Week Pass that gives you access to all the activities at an additional discount. I'd like to personally thank Veeam for their continued support---I believe work/life balance is an important defense against burnout, and it's great to see a company letting their actions demonstrate their support of work/life balance (instead of just empty corporate statements).

These activities will almost certainly sell out, so [register today][link-1]!

(BTW, for all things Spousetivities-related, be sure to check out [the newly-updated Spousetivities web site][link-3].)
