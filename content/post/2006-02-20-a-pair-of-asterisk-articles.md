There's been a bit of an [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) convergence recently, or at least for me. I've come across a couple of articles that share one thing in common: the open source Asterisk VoIP PBX software. From wireless routers to virtual machines, Asterisk is making some noise.

First, there was this article from [Nerd Vittles](http://mundy.org/blog/index.php) about a [prebuilt Asterisk@Home virtual machine](http://mundy.org/blog/index.php?p=116) (instead to be used with the free [VMware Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/), but conceivably also usable with the upcoming free VMware Server) [available from vmwarez.com](http://www.vmwarez.com/2006/02/asteriskhome-virtual-machine-updated.html). For all of us who've thought about experimenting with Asterisk, now we have no more excuses. With a prebuilt VM that has already taken the tedium from building an Asterisk PBX, now all we have to do is load it up and start tinkering. (Nerd Vittles also has a great article on the [setup of Asterisk@Home 2.5](http://mundy.org/blog/index.php?p=112).)

(Note: [Asterisk@Home](http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/) is a project that combines Asterisk with the base operating system---[CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) 4.2---and a number of associated applications for easy installation and deployment.)

Then, I find this article from [NewsForge](http://www.newsforge.com/) about [Asterisk@Home running on OpenWrt](http://mobile.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/02/09/1727256&from=rss). [OpenWrt](http://openwrt.org/) is a Linux distribution designed for wireless routers; specifically, the [Linksys](http://www.linksys.com/) WRT54 series. It's cool enough being able to load a full Linux distribution onto a wireless router, but it's even cooler being able to turn that wireless router into an open source VoIP PBX as well. What will they think of next?
