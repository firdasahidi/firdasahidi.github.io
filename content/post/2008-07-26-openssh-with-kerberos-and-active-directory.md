I ran across [this handy white paper](http://port25.technet.com/archive/2008/06/06/technical-analysis-openssh-on-linux-using-windows-kerberos-for-authentication.aspx) about OpenSSH on Linux using Kerberos authentication with Windows and Active Directory. There's not a whole lot in there that isn't also covered in [my Active Directory integration notes][1], but it is useful information nevertheless.
