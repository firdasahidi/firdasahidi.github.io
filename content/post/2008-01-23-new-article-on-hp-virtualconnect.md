For some good information on using HP VirtualConnect with VMware ESX Server, go check out [this article](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1295274,00.html) just published by [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/):

>While the idea of server profiles can be useful in VMware Infrastructure 3 (VI3) environments, Virtual Connect's ability to integrate with VLAN tagging configurations is perhaps more applicable to ESX Server deployments on c-Class blades. In this article, we'll take a look at how VirtualConnect integrates with ESX Server with regards to networking configurations.

Of course, I'm a bit partial to this particular author (wink, wink), but it is a good article nevertheless.

Feel free to hit me up with any corrections, comments, or thoughts. And be sure to go read my article, so TechTarget will keep asking me to write for them!
