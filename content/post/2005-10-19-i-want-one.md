The new [Sun](http://www.sun.com/) "Galaxy" x64 servers (the [Sun Fire X4100](http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x4100/specifications.jsp) and [Sun Fire X4200](http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x4200/specifications.jsp)) are wicked cool. Hot-swappable 2.5" Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) drives...dual-core [AMD Opteron](http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8796,00.html) CPUs...quad built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports...it's enough to make me want one. Even better, they run Windows, Linux, or Solaris (all fully supported by Sun, too). It's almost like having your cake and eating it, too.
