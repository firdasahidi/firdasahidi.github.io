In the event you haven't heard elsewhere already, the special Christmas present that Veeam had in store for the virtualization community was a new, free version of Veeam Monitor. The addition of this free solution gives system administrators a new option for real-time monitoring of VMware Infrastructure environments.

Anyone can go and download a copy from [the Veeam website](http://www.veeam.com/). That's assuming, of course, that you _can_ actually download the software, as I've been trying to do all morning. I'm sure that once the initial excitement and the mad rush of downloads subsides, it will be much easier and much faster, but for those of you who just absolutely positively have to have it right now, good luck!
