[Registration is now open][link-1] for Spousetivities at VMworld EMEA 2108 in Barcelona! Crystal just opened registration in the last day or so, and I wanted to help get the message out about these activities.<!--more-->

Here's a quick peek at what Crystal has lined up for Spousetivities participants:

* A visit to the coastal village of Calella de Palafrugell, the village of Llafranc, and Pals (one of the most well-preserved medieval villages in all of Catalunya), along with wine in the Empord√° region
* Tour of the Dali Museum
* Lunch and tour of Girona
* A lunch-time food tour
* A visit to the Collsera Natural Park and Mount Tibidabo, along with lunch at a 16th century stone farmhouse

For even more details, visit [the Spousetivities site][link-2].

These activities look _amazing_. Even if you've been to Barcelona before, these unique activities and tours are **not** available to the public---they're specially crafted specifically for Spousetivities participants.

Prices for all these activities are reduced thanks to [Veeam][link-3]'s sponsorship, and to help make things even more affordable there is a Full Week Pass that gives you access to all the activities at an additional discount.

These activities will almost certainly sell out, so [register today][link-1]!

**Side note:** Helping bring a more sane work-life balance to the demanding and often draining schedules of IT conferences like VMworld is something about which I'm very passionate. I believe that a lack of work-life balance is a strong contributing factor to burnout. Supporting Spousetivities is one small thing that I can do. That's why I post these announcements, and why I do my best to help spread word of the activities. I'd ask you to please consider how you might be able to help.
