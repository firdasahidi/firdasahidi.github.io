To make things a bit easier, I've created a Google Calendar for my VMworld 2008 schedule and activities. If you're interested in meeting up with me at VMworld 2008, check [this Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jnneb0d40n2jc7btifoavj2lms%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) for available times and then contact me. I can't hyperlink to the specific dates for the conference, so you'll need to manually navigate to the week of September 15. I can't promise that I'll be able to meet with you, but I will certainly try.
