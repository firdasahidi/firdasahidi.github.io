## Keynotes

Bryan Liles kicked off the day 3 morning keynotes with a discussion of "finding Kubernetes' Rails moment"---basically focusing on how Kubernetes enables folks to work on/solve higher-level problems. Key phrase from Bryan's discussion (which, as usual, incorporated the humor I love to see from Bryan): "Kubernetes isn't the destination. Kubernetes is the vehicle that takes us to the destination." Ian Coldwater delivered a talk on looking at Kubernetes from the attacker's point of view, and using that perspective to secure and harden Kubernetes. Two folks from Walmart also discussed their use case, which involves running Kubernetes clusters in retail locations to support a point-of-sale (POS) application at the check-out register. Finally, there was a discussion of chaos engineering from folks at Gremlin and Target.

## No Breakout Sessions

Due to booth duty and my flight home, I wasn't able to attend any breakout sessions today.

## Event Summary

If I'm completely honest, I didn't get as much out of the event as I'd hoped. I'm not yet sure if that is because I didn't get to attend as many sessions as I'd hoped/planned (due to problems with sessions being moved/rescheduled or whatever), if my choice of sessions was just poor, if it was just me/my personality, if I'm not the target audience for this event, or if it is some combination of these factors. I did enjoy seeing other folks in the community, meeting some folks that I hadn't met before, and being able to help answer some questions. From that perspective, the event was a success.
