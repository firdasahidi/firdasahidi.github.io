The next major version of VMware Fusion, version 2.0, has been released and is now available for download. The best part? It's a free upgrade for registered owners of Fusion 1.x. I have to applaud VMware's approach on this; rewarding early adopters with a free upgrade is something a lot of vendors should consider.

I won't go through the whole long features list here; just go read it for yourself [from VMware's site](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/features.html).

As soon as I've been able to download the new version and install it (which, at the rate of The Venetian's Internet connection, may not be until next week), I'll post more information.
