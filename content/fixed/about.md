<img src="/public/img/slowe-inside-small-02-150x150.png" alt="" title="Scott Lowe" width="150" height="150" />Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Scott Lowe, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.

## Personal Information

I live with my wife, Crystal, and our kids in the Denver, CO area. When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I'm enjoying the outdoor life or working in our church.

## Professional Information

I've been in the Information Technology field for more than 25 years, starting out with desktop support. Along the way, I've worked as an instructor, a technical trainer and Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), a systems administrator, an IT manager, a systems engineer, a consultant, as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for a small start-up, as the practice lead for a national VAR's VMware practice, as a forward-looking technologist for a large enterprise storage company, and as a technologist for [VMware][8] focusing on network virtualization and modern applications platforms (the latter role as a result of VMware's acquisition of Heptio).

Currently, I work for [Kong, Inc.][6] as a Principal Field Engineer. In my role, I'm focused on helping customers solve service connectivity challenges through Kong's portfolio of products, including service mesh and API gateway.

In addition, I am a former contributor to [SearchVMware.com][1], a VMware-focused website with technical articles, how-to's, tips, and news. I also had some articles published on [SearchServerVirtualization.com][2] and I am a former columnist for [Virtualization Review][3] magazine.

I currently have seven traditionally published books to my credit:

* *Mastering VMware vSphere 4*, published around VMworld 2009
* *VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference* (with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson), published in late 2009
* *VMware vSphere Design* (with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing), published in March 2011
* *Mastering VMware vSphere 5*, published in October 2011
* *VMware vSphere Design, 2nd Edition* (with Forbes Guthrie), published in March 2013 with updated content for vSphere 5.1 and vCloud Director
* *Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5* (with Nick Marshall, who took over other books in this series), published in November 2013
* *Network Programmability and Automation* (with Jason Edelman and Matt Oswalt), published in March 2018

Some of these books are available from Amazon.com and other major booksellers, although many of the older books may no longer be available.

In the summer of 2014, I collaborated with a number of others to produce a book titled *OpenStack Architecture Design Guide*. This book is available online [via the OpenStack web site][5], but it is no longer being updated for more recent releases of OpenStack.

If you'd like more information, my LinkedIn profile is available [here][4], and my GitHub profile is available [here][7].
